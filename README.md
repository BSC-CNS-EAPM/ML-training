# ML-training
This repository contains jupyter notebooks/python code to apply knowledge obtained during EAPML seminars.

## 1st seminar: Introduction to Neural Networks
As dummy data, a XOR data set is created. The aim is to create a neural network to classify correctly the data points. 
The notebook contains the code to create a neural network as an example for doing so.
The objective is to be familiar with neural network architectures and the different hyperparameters.
